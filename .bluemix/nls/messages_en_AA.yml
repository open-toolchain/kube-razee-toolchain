template.name: "1:Develop a Kubernetes app with Razee"
template.description: "2:With this toolchain, you can develop an application, and deploy changes using a Razee agent in your Kubernetes cluster. \n\nBy default, the toolchain uses a sample Node.js \"Hello World\" app, but you can link to your own GitHub repository instead. This toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery with [Vulnerability Advisor](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/va?topic=va-va_index), [Code Risk Analyzer](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-cd-configure-cra-repos), source control, issue tracking, and online editing. \n\nYou can manage your IBM Cloud Container clusters in the [console](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters). \n\nThis toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in the selected resource group or organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added with the free [Lite](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/) plan selected. \n\nTo get started, click **Create**. \n\nFor more information, see [Razee.io](https://razee.io)."
template.gettingStarted: "3: **Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to the Git repo to trigger a new Docker image build, which will be scanned for vulnerabilites and deployed in your Kubernetes cluster. For step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/tutorials/use-develop-kubernetes-app-with-razee-toolchain?task=2) for this toolchain."
